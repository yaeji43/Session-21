# Schedule


## Day 1 – Introduction to Software Engineering 

"Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics; i.e. it always increases." 

~ Norman Ralph Augustine

## Day 2 – Databases

"On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."

~ Charles Babbage

## Day 5 — GPU Accelerated Computing and Hack Session 

"It takes four hundred thirty people to man a starship. With this, you don't need anyone. One machine can do all those things they send men out to do now. Men no longer need die in space, or on some alien world. Men can live, and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take. Can't understand. We don't want to destroy life, we want to save it."

~ Dr. Richard Daystrom, Star Trek TOS: The Ultimate Computer
