    "In this exercise, we will be using object-oriented programming to build a flashcard study tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The minimal version of this tool will provide functionality to:\n",
    "- review a deck of flashcards within a \"quiz session\"\n",
    "- view your score at the end of the quiz session\n",
    "- track your scores over all your sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can expand it by adding the optional advanced features, such as:\n",
    "- providing command-line interfaces for creating, editing, and deleting flashcards\n",
    "- providing command-line interfaces managing multiple decks\n",
    "- implementing spaced repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optionally, you can use this as an opportunity to practice the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start out by writing the minimal version, one class at a time. If you're feeling like a challenge, try taking a few minutes beforehand to sketch out your own set of classes and what data and functionality they'll need."
